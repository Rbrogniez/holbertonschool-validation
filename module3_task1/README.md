## Prerequisites

* Shell terminal basics

* Git with the command line
* Make/Makefile usage
* A HTML5-compliant web browser
* A free account on GitHub, referenced as `<GitHub Handle>`
* A shell terminal with `bash` `zsh` or `ksh`, including the standard Unix toolset (`ls`, `cd`, etc.) with:
    - GNU Make in version 3.81+
    - Git (command line) in version 2+
    - `Go Hugo` v0.80+

## Lifecycle

* `build` : Generate the website from the markdown and configuration files in the directory `dist/`.
* `clean` : Cleanup the content of the directory `dist/`
* `post` : Create a new blog post whose filename and title come from the environment variables `POST_TITLE` and `POST_NAME`.
* `help` : prints out the list of targets and their usage.
* `lint` : Print the yaml file

## Workflow

This project needs the following tools / services:

* The command lines
    - yq
    - shellcheck

## Build Workflow

Regarding the tooling, you have to:

* Ensure that the workflow is executed into an Ubuntu 18.04 execution environment
* Ensure that all the required tools are installed prior to any make target, by executing the script setup.sh
    - The script should be modified to only install missing tools (no make target are expected)
